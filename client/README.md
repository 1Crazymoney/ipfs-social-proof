# Autonomica IPFS Social Proof - client app

Autonomica is a front-end app written with `yo-yo` & `Tachyons` in order to stay small and nimble

## Goals

* Ui to help establish IPFS-driven identity
* Dissemination of `Identity Proofs` a'la Keybase
* e.g.: signed JSON posted to github, referenced via social media and DNS
* Exchange of public signing keys to verify proofs

### Install

`cd client/ && npm install`

`npm start`

Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8889/`

### Warning

* This is `alpha` software with `alpha` software as its `dependencies` & should be thought of as a proof of concept that needs a lot of work.
* PRs welcome, see CONTRIBUTING.md
